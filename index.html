					<h2>Reactive Infrastructure with Docker and MongoDB</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is Docker?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is a Container?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem 
						<li class="fragment">anything you can install on a server. 
						<li class="fragment">contains everything it needs to run
						<li class="fragment">code, runtime, system tools, system libraries  
						<li class="fragment">This guarantees that it will always run the same, 
						<li class="fragment">regardless of the environment it is running in.
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>How does this help you build better software?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">When your app is in Docker containers you don’t have to worry about setting up and maintaining different
							environments or different tooling for each language.
						<li class="fragment">Focus on creating new features, fixing issues and shipping software.
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Accelerate Developer Onboarding</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Stop wasting hours trying to setup developer environments, spin up new instances and make copies of
							production code to run locally.
						<li class="fragment">With Docker, you can easily take copies of your live environment and run on any new endpoint running Docker.





						
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Empower Developer Creativity</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">The isolation capabilities of Docker containers free developers from the worries of using “approved”
							language stacks and tooling.
						<li class="fragment">Developers can use the best language and tools for their application service without worrying about causing
							conflict issues.
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Eliminate Environment Inconsistencies</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">By packaging up the application with its configs and dependencies together and shipping as a container, the
							application will always work as designed locally, on another machine, in test or production.
						<li class="fragment">No more worries about having to install the same configs into a different environment.
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Ship 7X More</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Docker users on average ship software 7X more after deploying Docker in their environment.
						<li class="fragment">More frequent updates provide more value to your customers faster.
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Quickly Scale</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Docker containers spin up and down in seconds making it easy to scale an application service at any time to
							satisfy peak customer demand, then just as easily spin down those containers to only use the resources you need when you need it
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>

					<h2>Easily Remediate Issues</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Docker make it easy to identify issues and isolate the problem container, quickly roll back to make the
							necessary changes then push the updated container into production.
						<li class="fragment">The isolation between containers make these changes less disruptive than traditional software models.
					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Examples</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment">Single Instance - versions 2.6, v3.0, v3.3
						<li class="fragment">Replica Set with Auth and Fixture
							<ul>
								<li>1 container - 2 data, 1 arbiter
								<Li>--keyfile for node communication
								<li>auth setup with user defined
								<li>fixture data pre-populated in collection
							</ul>
						<li class="fragment">Docker Compose -
							<ul>
								<li>MongoDB 3.2 - replica set
								<li>4 containers - 3 data and 1 setup
							</ul>
					</ol>
